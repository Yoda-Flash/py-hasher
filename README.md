# py-hasher
Hashes strings and demonstrates the AES cipher.

Both sha-256 files are for running the SHA-256 algorithm to hash messages based on user  input, and provide the same result, but one is coded from scratch by me and one is implementing a method from a library.

The AES-GCM file is a demo of the AES cipher, where you can input your own key and message and view it be encrypted and then decrypted. 

Follow the program instructions to run, and enjoy!

If you wish to use a GUI, run the gui.py program and enter all the necessary fields!
