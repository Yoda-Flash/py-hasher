# py-hasher
Hashes strings and demonstrates the AES cipher.

Both sha-256 files are for running the SHA-256 algorithm to hash messages based on user  input, and provide the same result, but one is coded from scratch by me and one is implementing a method from a library.

The AES-GCM file is a demo of the AES cipher, where you can input your own key and message and view it be encrypted and then decrypted. 

Follow the program instructions to run, and enjoy!
